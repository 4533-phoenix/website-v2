## Overview

This season required us to pick up orange donuts (called notes). We then had to
climb on a chain and the human player had to score a special note (high note) on
a pole in the middle of the field. This was our second year in the Peachtree
District. We went to the Anderson and North Chaleston district events. We were
alliance captain of alliance 4 during Anderson and we were 1st pick of alliance
5 in Charleston. We also reached the District Championship and ended up being
the alliance captain of alliance 7.
