## Overview

We were required to pick up small yellow nerf balls this year for the
competition. We went to the Palmetto Regional, Ranking 7th and having our Mentor
Mrs. Cheesman become a Woodie Flowers Finalist. However, COVID-19 then struck,
shutting down the competition for the rest of the season.
