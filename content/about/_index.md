## Who are we?

Phoenix is an FRC team operating out of the East Cooper Center for Advanced
Studies in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Each member of our team grows and
applies skills that are directly relevant to future work in STEM fields. Since
our 2013 debut, team 4533's robots have competed at a high level, earning many
awards and honors.

## Our History

Team 4533 was founded as Wando Advanced Robotics during the 2012-13 school year
and first competed in the 2013 FRC game, Ultimate Ascent. In 2014, our team
reached the playoff rounds for the first time at the South Florida Regional,
ultimately making it to the semifinals. In 2015, our team continued to improve,
becoming an alliance captain for the first time and earning the General Motors
Industrial Design Award at the North Carolina Regional. During the 2017 season,
our team won the Imagery Award at the Palmetto Regional and placed highly at the
Smoky Mountains Regional. In the 2018 game, Power Up, our team captained
alliances at both the Rocket City Regional and the South Florida Regional and
recieved the Quality Award at Rocket City. In 2020, the team became an alliance
captain at the Palmetto Regional. In 2021, despite the cancellation of in-person
FRC events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team continued to improve by
experimenting with new designs and participating in at-home challenges.
Following our move to the East Cooper CAS ahead of the 2022-23 school year, our
team rebranded as Phoenix. We are beyond excited to continue to grow our team's
legacy in the coming years!

## Subteams

Each member of our team works as a part of one of six subteams. This simplifies
the process of creating a complex robot, allowing us to explore more advanced
techniques and projects during a short build season. While each of our members
is assigned to work primarily with one subteam, many will learn skills in two or
more areas throughout their time with our team. You can read about each of our
subteams below.

### Code

The Coding team is responsible for programming all of our robot's functions. Members use several programming languages, including Java and Python, to create software that allows our robots to operate at an advanced level.

### Build

The Build team is responsible for the creation of individual parts and the assembly of our robot. Students learn and apply skills in construction, engineering, and mechanics.
