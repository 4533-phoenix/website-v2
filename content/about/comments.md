## Comments

{{< paige/quote cite="Matthew Stewart, Class of 2021" >}} "I like robotics
because it teaches you a lot and it helps you realize how school and real life
come together. It really gives me a taste of what real jobs are like." {{<
/paige/quote >}}

{{< paige/quote cite="Joseph Lee, Class of 2019" >}} “Robotics encourages
innovation and creativity, and the team itself gives you opportunities that
allow you to interact with others and help you in the future.”

{{< paige/quote cite="Alexis Utnik, Class of 2023" >}} “This team has taught me so
much about Leadership, Friendship, and Engineering. The people on the team
become your family and you create connections like no other that you will have
for years to come.” {{< /paige/quote >}}

{{< paige/quote cite="Alex Reed, Class of 2024" >}} "I've learned so much through 
robotics as a student, as a leader, and as a person. Without it, I wouldn't be the 
person I am today." {{< /paige/quote >}}
