## Overview

We were required to pick up very large tennis balls called cargo, and launch
them into a hub where they were counted for points. We also had to climb a
series of increasingly higher rungs. We went to Electric City and Smoky Mountain
Regionals in season, and SCRIW off-season. We were finalists at Electric City
and SCRIW.
