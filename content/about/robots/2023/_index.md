## Overview

This season required us to pick up cones and cubes and put them onto poles and
boxes to score points. After that we had to balance on a balance beam, with the
other robots on our alliance. This was our first year in the Peachtree District.
We went to the Anderson and Hartsville district events and we were first pick of
the Second Alliance and Captain of the Fourth Alliance respectivly. We also
reached the District Championship and ended up being the Second Pick of the
Second Alliance.
