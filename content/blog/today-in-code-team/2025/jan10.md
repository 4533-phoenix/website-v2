## Overview

Drake, Ethan, and Sean researched and fixed all the API changes.
They added some comments to document this.

 > "I really wish they documented better but I think all the code has been updated correctly, however, it still needs testing."
 > --Drake

They got the code down to 4 issues but after an hour of debugging it seems to be a problem where the Kotlin Unit library is overwriting the WPILib Unit library.
Drake's going to try getting help on the Kotlin discord to get help as he assumes it's a common problem.
After this is fixed, we should have working code.
Sean and Ethan also researched YAGSL and how to configure the robot.

Chloe installed a Pi Cam v3 in the Raspberry Pi for vision testing.
We tried to troubleshoot the camera configuration to get RGB8 output from the camera, while Eda edited the code on the Pi and learned to use vi.
Chloe learned about ssh and got the code off of the Pi.
Lincoln helped Chloe get Docker Desktop installed, then she removed it and installed Podman Desktop.
