So we're going to do a blog post every (meeting) day this year, summarizing our accomplishments and mistakes.

Drake helped everyone on robot code get WPILib 2025 installed, which took forever over the school's WiFi connection.
In the meantime, the rookies learned kotlin which is what we are going to program for the robot.

Here's Sean's Kotlin notes:

Chloe flashed a fresh image onto a Pi 5 for vision testing.
She also started learning Linux.

Our main bottleneck today was the school network's censorship of Linux package repositories and heavily throttled WiFi.
We have our own router set up to circumvent the Linux blockage, but it broke yet again.
We used OpenWRT last year, but it was kinda broken.
We burned that down and did raw OpenBSD with PF instead this year.
It worked great for a little while, but the school's been clamping down again.
Lincoln tried to fix the router with some very short-lived success and much pain.

## Thing of the day
