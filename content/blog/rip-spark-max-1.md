Today is a sad day. We lost a trooper in the field. The Spark Max, a motor controller that has been with us since the beginning of the season, has been fried. The cause of death is unknown, but it is suspected that the motor controller was plugged in backwards. The motor controller was found dead on the field, with the smell of burnt electronics filling the air. The Spark Max will be missed, but we will continue to fight on in its memory. It was declared dead at 4:20 pm on October 2nd, 2024 with the cause of 12v gate fault. Rest in peace, Spark Max. You will be missed.
